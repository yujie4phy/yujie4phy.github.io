HiÔºÅI'm Yujie, a PhD student at unversity of Illinois Urbana Champaign in the department of Physics, co-advised by [Prof. Virginia Lorenz](https://physics.illinois.edu/people/directory/profile/vlorenz) and [Prof. Eric Chitambar](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/echitamb). My research focus on photonic quantum information processing, quantum sensing and quantum foundations. And I am broadly interested in quantum information theory and its experimental implemention on photonic system. Prior to that, I recieved my undergraduate degree from Kuangyaming honor school, [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/EN/main.htm), where I worked with [Prof.Lijian Zhang](https://eng.nju.edu.cn/intl/45/3b/c34798a476475/page.htm)
