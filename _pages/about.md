HiÔºÅI'm Yujie, a Postdoc fellow at Insitute for quantum computing (IQC), University of Waterloo, supervised by [Prof. Thomas Jennewein](https://uwaterloo.ca/physics-astronomy/profile/tjennewe) in photonic quantum information processing.  I am broadly interestied in theoretical discussion on different notation of nonclassicality in quantum theory and behind including their testification, quantification, realization and eventually application using photonic platforms. 

Previously, I was a PhD student at [unversity of Illinois Urbana Champaign in the department of Physics](https://physics.illinois.edu/), co-advised by [Prof. Virginia Lorenz](https://physics.illinois.edu/people/directory/profile/vlorenz) in quantum optics experiment and [Prof. Eric Chitambar](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/echitamb) in quantum information theory. My research focus on photonic quantum information processing, quantum sensing and quantum foundations. And I am broadly interested in quantum information theory and its experimental implemention on photonic system. Prior to that, I recieved my undergraduate degree from Kuangyaming honor school, [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/EN/main.htm), where I worked with [Prof.Lijian Zhang](https://eng.nju.edu.cn/intl/45/3b/c34798a476475/page.htm)
